*TASK DESCRIPTION*

As part of my internship, I worked on developing an Interactive Quiz Application to strengthen my practical knowledge of front-end web development. This project gave me hands-on experience in creating a dynamic and user-friendly web application. The main goal of this task was to design a quiz system where users can answer multiple-choice questions and easily view their score based on the number of correct answers they choose.

The application was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a JSON file. HTML was used to build the basic structure of the quiz, including the question section, answer options, navigation buttons, and score display. CSS was applied to style the application with a clean and visually appealing design, focusing on proper spacing, readable fonts, and balanced color combinations. A simple and well-organized layout was maintained to ensure clarity and ease of use for users.

JavaScript was used to manage the core functionality of the application. It handles the dynamic loading of quiz questions, records user responses, checks answers, calculates the score, and provides real-time feedback. All quiz questions, options, and correct answers are stored in a JSON file, which helps separate the data from the application logic. This structure makes the application easier to manage and allows questions to be updated or added without modifying the main code.

The quiz includes multiple-choice questions that appear one at a time. Users select an answer and move forward using simple navigation controls. Each response is evaluated, and the score is updated based on correct answers. Once the quiz is completed, the final score is displayed clearly, allowing users to quickly assess their performance.

User experience was a major focus during development. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface, smooth navigation, and clear instructions to ensure easy interaction. Real-time feedback keeps users engaged throughout the quiz, and the intuitive layout makes the application suitable for users of all skill levels.

During the development process, I faced challenges such as managing dynamic content, handling user input efficiently, and ensuring accurate score calculation. These challenges were addressed by using well-structured JavaScript functions and effective event handling techniques. Through this task, I gained valuable experience in DOM manipulation, working with JSON data, responsive design, and front-end logic development.

Overall, the Interactive Quiz Application proved to be a valuable internship project that strengthened my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. It provided practical exposure to real-world web development concepts and demonstrated my ability to design, develop, and implement an interactive web-based application.
